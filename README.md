# Drone-with-Object-Tracking
- Assembled a DM002 Remote Control Quadcopter with camera
- Recorded video from the drone camera in real-time
- Transmitted the video capture to device using WIFI
- Implemented the pre-existing YOLO model(you-only-look-once) for object detection and tracking
- The model is capable of detecting and naming multiple objects on a single video frame from a wide range of options(human, umbrella, bottle, etc)
- Coded in Python using libraries like Numpy, OpenCV, Darknet.

# Steps for Assembling
-	<b>Assemble the frame:</b> Follow the instructions that come with your frame to assemble it.
-	<b>Install the motors and ESCs:</b> Attach the motors to the frame and connect them to the ESCs (Electronic Speed Controllers) using the appropriate wiring.
-	<b>Install the flight controller:</b> Mount the flight controller to the frame and connect it to the ESCs and other components.
-	<b>Add the battery and power distribution board:</b> Install the battery and power distribution board, which connects the battery to the flight controller and other components.
-	<b>Attach the propellers:</b> Attach the propellers to the motors, making sure they are securely fastened
-	<b>Calibrate the flight controller:</b> Follow the instructions provided with the flight controller to calibrate it, which involves setting up the quadcopter's orientation and configuring other settings.
