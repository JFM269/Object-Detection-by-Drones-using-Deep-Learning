# Drone-with-Object-Tracking
- Assembled a DM002 Remote Control Quadcopter with camera
- Recorded video from the drone camera in real-time
- Transmitted the video capture to device using WIFI
- Implemented the pre-existing YOLO model(you-only-look-once) for object detection and tracking
- The model is capable of detecting and naming multiple objects on a single video frame from a wide range of options(human, umbrella, bottle, etc)
- Coded in Python using libraries like Numpy, OpenCV, Darknet.
